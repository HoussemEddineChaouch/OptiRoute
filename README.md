## Overview

OptiRoute is a React-based web app that allows users to **create graphs**, **assign edge weights**, and **solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a brute-force algorithm.  
It provides an **interactive graph canvas** powered by ReactFlow and a **step-by-step solution display** with detailed path costs.

---

## Features

- Interactive graph editor (add nodes & edges by clicking)
- Assign custom weights (edge costs)
- Brute-force TSP solver (O(n!))
- Visualize the optimal route & path details
- Download presentation (PPTX)
- Built with **React, TailwindCSS, ReactFlow**

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/HoussemEddineChaouch/optiroute.git
cd optiroute

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Double-click on the canvas to add nodes.
2. Connect nodes by dragging edges â†’ enter a weight.
3. Click "Solve TSP with Brute Force".
4. View the optimal path and cost in the results panel.
5. Reset to start a new problem instance.

## Algorithm

- TSP Brute Force: Generates all possible permutations of nodes.
- Selects the minimum-cost cycle that visits all nodes exactly once.
- Handles disconnected graphs (returns "No valid path").

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**!

### Contribution Guidelines

- Please make sure your code follows the existing style.
- Add comments where necessary for clarity.
- Test your changes before submitting.
- If fixing a bug, include the issue number in your commit message.
- Keep PRs focused on a single change (easier to review).

### Ideas for Contributions

- Add more TSP algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Nearest Neighbor).
- Improve UI/UX with more visualizations.
